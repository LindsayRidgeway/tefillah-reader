## 📦 Project Structure

This is a single-page app. All logic and data reside in the following files:

- `index.html` – Main user interface and logic  
- `shema-prayers.js` – Word-by-word structure for Shema-related prayers  
- `amidah-blessings.js` – Word-by-word Amidah blessings  
- `sabbath-blessings.js` – Prayers for Sabbath meals and rituals  
- `ritual-items.js` – Hebrew words for ritual objects (educational/fun category)  

## 🔧 Customization & Extensions

The app is designed for clarity and ease of use, so no user-facing customization is required. That said, the code is open and simple—other developers are welcome to fork the repository and extend it. Ideas include:

- Adding Sephardic transliterations  
- Including new prayer categories  
- Implementing Text-to-Speech (TTS)  
- Offering translations or explanations  

## 🚀 Running Locally

To run locally, simply:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/tefillah-reader.git

(You can also double-click the file in Finder or open it in any modern browser.)
